# UFOs Sightings:Fact or Fancy?

The purpose of this project is to create a webpage for the interested readers to read the article about the 
UFOs sightings by some people in some areas and the research done by the Ufologists. 

The webpage displays all the details in the form of a well structured table. This table can be filtered by the 
user inputs based on date, city, state, country and shape(of UFOs).

## The webpage has been designed by using javascipt and html. The webpage has been well arranged and decorated
using Bootstrap features and css.

## For further development and progress of this project, we can add more data from different parts of the world
rather than using only USA data.This will increase the number of interested readers.
